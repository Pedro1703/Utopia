### Grant Proposal: Integrating Gnosis Safe for Secure and Decentralized Media Operations with Utopia

**Project Title:** Enhancing Utopia: Leveraging Gnosis Safe for Secure and Decentralized Media Management  
**Applicant:** Futuria DAO  
**Funding Request:** $90,000 USD

---

### Project Overview

#### What We Want to Build
We propose to enhance Utopia, our open-source technology stack designed for independent media, by integrating Gnosis Safe to secure digital assets and manage decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. Utopia, already equipped with IPFS for decentralized storage, will utilize Gnosis Safe to ensure secure fund management, paywall protection, and operational security for media companies. Our project will focus on creating custom modules and integrations with Gnosis Safe that cater specifically to the needs of media organizations operating in decentralized environments.

**Key Features:**
- **Custom Gnosis Safe Modules for Media:** Development of tailored modules for Gnosis Safe that manage subscriptions, paywalls, and media licensing payments.
- **Multi-Signature Security for Content Distribution:** Implementation of multi-signature setups for secure and transparent decision-making in media content publishing and distribution.
- **DeFi Integration for Media Funding:** Integrate Gnosis Safe with decentralized finance (DeFi) tools to enable media companies to securely manage crowdfunding, donations, and other funding mechanisms.

#### Why We Want to Build It
Independent media organizations are increasingly vulnerable to censorship and financial instability. By integrating Gnosis Safe into Utopia, we aim to provide these organizations with a secure and decentralized solution to manage their digital assets and financial operations. This integration will empower independent media to maintain operational autonomy, protect their financial resources, and build resilience against external pressures.

Gnosis Safe’s robust multi-signature functionality is particularly well-suited for media companies that require secure, collaborative decision-making processes, especially in environments where censorship or financial threats are prevalent.
